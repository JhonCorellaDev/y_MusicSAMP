To be able to carry out this process you will need a domain and an api, the use is very simple, it will only be enough to place the domain that is pointed to in the pawn script and the api + your domain in your php script

You will see this in your pawn code, all you have to do is simply change it to your domain, where you have the index.php code

Here you can see part of the php code, which is where we must clearly place our api and it must be connected to our domain
